# Project Name

Create a chatbot by pair programming using javascript

## The problem

1. Scetch bot script.
2. Looked at previous students chat bot to understand & used as reference.
3. Tested out different functions & had continous retros to understand why something worked & didn't.
4. If we had more time we would like to look in to how to style the select list.
